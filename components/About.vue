        <p>
          Our head barber Christine fell in love with Oak Bay, moving from
          Quebec and took over Nick's Hair Salon in 1996. Christine and her
          family have created a barbershop in Victoria BC that is warm friendly
          and relaxed. Every one who has walked through the door at Nickâ€™s Hair
          Salon feels welcomed.
        </p>
        <p>Our services are hair cuts and straight razor shaves.</p>
